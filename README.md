# Model_Of_Neural_Systems
Exercises of the Module Model Of Neural Systems. Neuron simulations, synaptic currents and HH models.
## Topic 1
Simulation of a McCulloch-Pitts neuron, which different activation functions (Sigmoid, Hyperbolic tangent, and Piecesiese linear can be used). Rosenblatt's perceptron and XOR function.

## Topic 2
Hopfield networks.

## Topic 3
Visual stimuli, and models of receptive fields, as well as tuning curves, and Gabor function use as Image filtering.

## Topic 4
Numerical solutions to ODEs, Euler method.

## Topic 5
Synaptic currents, membrane potential, IF neurons and synapses.

## Topic 6
Potassium channels, Sodium Channels and Voltage Clamps simulation.

## Topic 7
HH model simulation, input and voltage effect on the channels. Gating variables, and firing rates.
